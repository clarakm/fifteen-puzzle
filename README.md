# Fifteen Puzzle

Project Brief:

Using data and images made publicly available through the Unsplash API (https://unsplash.com/developers), we would like you to build a 15-tile puzzle game (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle), ideally using React.js. The Unsplash API allows for getting random (or non-random) high-resolution images. You should be able to:

- break the image up into 16 tiles
- discard the 16th tile
- randomize the order in such a way that the puzzle is solvable
- allow the user to unscramble the tiles per the rules of the game (IE: move the game pieces around)
- let the user know when the puzzle is complete

This is purposely left open-ended to some degree. There are any number of additional features that could be added (scoring, timing, searching images, etc). And the UI for rearranging tiles could range in complexity. Please implement what you see fit.

Additional Notes:

- Assume latest version of Chrome as the target platform. Feel free to use any modern browser APIs available.
- The logic and functionality of the puzzle is more important than the presentation of it.
- Submit your work via a link to a github repo.
